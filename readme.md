# MicroPython Snippets
I'll save in this repo snippets of code that I use when creating something with Micro Python.

To know what each snippet does, please refer to the readme file inside the folder.

One of the main reasons I created this repo is because I always lost the code from previous projects, and I had to 
rewrite everything from scratch. So, I decided to create some semi-decent code snippets that I can reuse in 
future projects. I hope this repo helps you as much as it helps me.



## Important notes
- Unless specified otherwise, consider all examples using Micropython v1.23.0 (2024-06-02) on a Raspberry Pi Pico.
- All snippets/classes as provided AS-IS, and although I've tested all of them, It was not a thorough test. So, please use them at your own risk. No warranty/guarantee is provided.
