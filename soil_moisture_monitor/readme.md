# Soil Moisture Monitor
This project is a soil moisture monitor that uses a Raspberry Pi Pico and a soil moisture sensor to monitor 
the moisture level of a plant. 

Right now it doesn't do much, but it calculates the percentage of moisture in the soil and prints it to the
serial console.

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Capacitive Soil Moisture 1.2 (KYES516)
